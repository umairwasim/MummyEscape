A Hyper casual game prototype where based on desert/Egyptian environment where you have to sneak into the pyramid by dodging crazy mummies. 
Each mummy has their own patrol radius, attack range, and damage dealt to the player. 

It has been built using free assets from Unity Asset Store and I am not the creator of 3D assets including environment and characters. 

It is an open project and anyone can fork/download it and use it to learn, expand, and refine.
